# Popcorn Dropper Privacy Policy

We value your comments, suggestions and feedback. Our Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use and disclose “personal information” and other “non-personal information” we have gathered about you about you in relation to our game “Popcorn Dropper”, (“Game” which term includes the associated website).

By using our Game, you acknowledge and consent to the terms of this privacy policy.

This policy will let you know:
  - What information (often referred to as ‘data’) is collected from you;
  - How your information is used;
  - With whom your information may be shared;
  - How you can access, update, or delete your information.

We will comply with all relevant and applicable legislative requirements, and, in the event of any inconsistency, the legislative requirements will override the provisions of this document.

# User Age Limits

Our games and our website are not aimed at children under 13 years of age. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our Game may unintentionally appeal to children. 

An age gate is in place at the launch of the Game, which shall direct each user to the part of the Game that is applicable to that user’s age bracket. 

We do not collect any personally identifiable information within the age gated part of our Game for children, nor do we intentionally direct interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 years. 

If you believe that We have inadvertently collected information from a person under the age of 13, please contact us at the email address below and the information will be permanently deleted. We do not permit behaviourally targeted advertising to children under the age of 13 years.
